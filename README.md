# Classification-Of-Fire-Types
🔥 Fire Type Classification in India Using MODIS Satellite Data

This project applies Machine Learning techniques to classify different fire types in India using MODIS satellite data (NASA FIRMS).
Fires such as forest fires, agricultural fires, and other fire events threaten ecosystems, air quality, and human lives.
With the right classification model, we can detect, monitor, and visualize these fires efficiently.

📌 Project Objectives

📊 Analyze and preprocess MODIS satellite fire data.

🧹 Handle missing values, perform feature engineering, and data encoding.

⚙️ Build ML models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM) to classify fire types.

📈 Evaluate models using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

🌍 Visualize geographic spread and frequency of fire types in India.
